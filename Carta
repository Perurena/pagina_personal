                                <strong> Subjects of study </strong>
                                <br /></p>
                                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects
                                fall somewher in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
                                and just the kind of person we´d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted
                                we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
                               <blockquote>
                                1. Turning H2Ointo wine, and the health benefits of Reveratol(C14H12O3)
                                <br>
                                    2. Measuring the effect on perfomance of funk bassplayer at the temperatures exceeding 30oC(86oF)
                            when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10 3> 3 x 10 4.)
                                <br>
                                3. HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</blockquote>
                                <br />
                                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how
                                long you´d expect the research to take required staff and other resources, and anything else you think
                                we´d need to know? Thanks.
                                <br /><br>
                                <strong> Exotic dance moves</strong>
                                <br /><br>
                                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, i did study exotic tribal dances. to answer
                                your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
                                <br />
                                
                                    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
                                    <blockquote>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far
                                    as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be ¨fruitful¨.</blockquote></p>
                                 <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle
                                    
                                    <blockquote> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance
                                     wich involved huddling close togrther in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
                                    in imperceptably tiny, very rapis movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought
                                    this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</blockquote></p>
                              
                                <p>Artic Robot Dance
                                    <br /><blockquote>
                                    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                                    discovered a new dance style characterised by ¨robottic¨, stilted movements, being practiced
                                     by inhabitants of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were
                                     just moving like this because they were really cold.

                                    </blockquote></p>
